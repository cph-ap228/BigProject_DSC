# Stage 1: 
## List of Project Ideas:
___________________________________
### ✔ Idea #1: AI - Targeted StockMarket Predictor
### Focus of *interest*:
It's in most peoples interest to cash in an extra bag of pocket change, albeit if it's successful this planned AI model would become quite wealthy. We would like to tackle the current/past data that is available, perhaps from a source like Kaggle.
### Why is it *interesting*
It's interesting cause there has been countless attempts in trying to advance in data mining the stock-market and find a way to literally trivilialize the usage of a stock market. The reason why the stock market still exists, is because no-one has come up with any sort of model or AI that is intelligent enough to make stocks irrelevant in terms of value by *cracking* the patterns. If everyone knew the movement of the stock market, it would essentially make it trivial.
### Which outcome do you expect from your research:
A clear null hypothesis that is proven to be correct, up until and if proven wrong. Meaning that real-world human and non human external factors (Politics, Conflicts, Natural Disasters, Pandemics etc.) are not to be taught for AI in our current day and age. 
### Who's the *target audience/our users?*:
Individuals who are keen to explore or learn the movement of stock-prices and the neverending question of if the market can be *cracked* to show specific patterns in it's movement.

## ✘ ~~Idea #2 : AI - Advanced Image Proccesing of Selfdriving Vehicles~~
### Focus of *interest*:
It is in our interest to figure out how AI Cameras and it's exremely fast scanning processes is used to determine and scan all road-signs, pedestrians, dangers around said vehicle to eventually provide humanity to get from point A to point B with no risk and effort involved. Perhaps we could go in and develop our own AI to acknowledge specific things of interest thatøs related to the above-mentioned idea or similar fields where the same procedures can be applied.
### Why is it *interesting?*:
It's interesting cause it gives us a glimpse of future transportation, and a technology that has really developed with tremendous speed over the last decade.
### Which outcome do you expect from your research:
A deeper understanding of how Image Processing works, working with ML and AI and also hopefully the satisfaction of a working Image Processing
### Who's the *target audience/our users?*:
Vehicle manufacturers and it's customers, road safety admissions, insurance companies.

## ✘ ~~Idea #3 : Medical - Statistics & Effectivenes of Vaccines~~
### Focus of *interest*:
The medical sector is huge, especially in Denmark. To data-mine and compare different vaccines and their effectiveness could grant a deeper understanding of what risk is associated when time is of the essence for these huge medical-companies in the medical sector. With a pandemic still happening a logical focus-point could be COVID-19 vaccines, first and/or second shot and the pro's and cons concerning the different types of vaccines there's in use (mRNA vaccine vs live-virus equivalent). 
### Why is it *interesting?*:
It's first and foremost extremely relevant, and we as individuals get an clear insight of what determining factors were taken into consideration for the development and distribution of these different types of vaccines, all over the world
### Which outcome do you expect from your research?:
Several interesting factors of why and how certain vaccines work as they do, and understanding why and how others have been over-shadowed as inferior.
### Who's the target *audience/our users?*:
The risk-group/elderly society of individuals, governments, medical sector.~~

# Stage 2: 

#### 1. Find relevant data sources:
## Data
Idea and data, based and used from this Link: https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs#Data.zip
Data is stored in the folder called "Stocks"

Our dataset may not describe too many features, but they are very descriptive, and a lot of times we end up dropping features that are not correlated anyway, so this may be to our advantage. The features are as follows: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt.

#### 2. Integrate the sources by either ETL or an ELT process
- Underway - 

#### 3. Design a Data Story or Data Processing Scenario
